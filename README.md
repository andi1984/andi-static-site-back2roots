# Twig + Markdown HTML Generator

Run `npm run build` to generate the HTML files based on the Markdown files saved inside the `md` folder.

The HTML content of the markdown files is going to be passed as `content` variable to the `templates.main.twig` file, which is currently used for all markdown files.

The output files are saved to the `dist` directory.
